.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dfu-util
is a program that implements the host (computer) side of the USB DFU
(Universal Serial Bus Device Firmware Upgrade) protocol.
.sp
dfu-util communicates with devices that implement the device side of the
USB DFU protocol, and is often used to upgrade the firmware of such
devices.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-l, \-\-list"
List the currently attached DFU capable USB devices.
.TP
.BR "\-d, \-\-device" " [\fIRun-Time VENDOR\fP]:[\fIRun-Time PRODUCT\fP][,[\fIDFU Mode VENDOR\fP]:[\fIDFU Mode PRODUCT\fP]]"
.RS
Specify run-time and/or DFU mode vendor and/or product IDs of the DFU device
to work with. \fBVENDOR\fP and \fBPRODUCT\fP are hexadecimal numbers (no prefix
needed), "*" (match any), or "-" (match nothing). By default, any DFU capable
device in either run-time or DFU mode will be considered.
.sp
If you only have one standards-compliant DFU device attached to your computer,
this parameter is optional. However, as soon as you have multiple DFU devices
connected, dfu-util will detect this and abort, asking you to specify which
device to use.
.sp
If only run-time IDs are specified (e.g. "\fB--device 1457:51ab\fP"), then in
addition to the specified run-time IDs, any DFU mode devices will also be
considered. This is beneficial to allow a DFU capable device to be found
again after a switch to DFU mode, since the vendor and/or product ID of a
device usually changes in DFU mode.
.sp
If only DFU mode IDs are specified (e.g. "\fB--device ,951:26\fP"), then all
run-time devices will be ignored, making it easy to target a specific device in
DFU mode.
.sp
If both run-time and DFU mode IDs are specified (e.g. "\fB--device
1457:51ab,:2bc\fP"), then unspecified DFU mode components will use the run-time
value specified.
.sp
Examples:
.TP
.B "--device 1457:51ab,951:26"
.br
Work with a device in run-time mode with
vendor ID 0x1457 and product ID 0x51ab, or in DFU mode with vendor ID 0x0951
and product ID 0x0026
.sp
.TP
.B "--device 1457:51ab,:2bc"
.br
Work with a device in run-time mode with vendor ID 0x1457 and product ID
0x51ab, or in DFU mode with vendor ID 0x1457 and product ID 0x02bc
.sp
.TP
.B "--device 1457:51ab"
.br
Work with a device in run-time mode with vendor ID 0x1457 and product ID
0x51ab, or in DFU mode with any vendor and product ID
.sp
.TP
.B "--device ,951:26"
.br
Work with a device in DFU mode with vendor ID 0x0951 and product ID 0x0026
.sp
.TP
.B "--device *,-"
.br
Work with any device in run-time mode, and ignore any device in DFU mode
.sp
.TP
.B "--device ,"
.br
Ignore any device in run-time mode, and Work with any device in DFU mode
.RE
.TP
.BR "\-p, \-\-path" " BUS-PORT. ... .PORT"
Specify the path to the DFU device.
.TP
.BR "\-c, \-\-cfg" " CONFIG-NR"
Specify the configuration of the DFU device. Note that this is only used for matching, the configuration is not set by dfu-util.
.TP
.BR "\-i, \-\-intf" " INTF-NR"
Specify the DFU interface number.
.TP
.BR "\-a, \-\-alt" " ALT"
Specify the altsetting of the DFU interface by name or by number.
.TP
.BR "\-S, \-\-serial" " [\fIRun-Time SERIAL\fP][,[\fIDFU Mode SERIAL\fP]]"
Specify the run-time and DFU mode serial numbers used to further restrict
device matches.  If multiple, identical DFU devices are simultaneously
connected to a system then vendor and product ID will be insufficient for
targeting a single device.  In this situation, it may be possible to use this
parameter to specify a serial number which also must match.
.sp
If only a single serial number is specified, then the same serial number is
used in both run-time and DFU mode. An empty serial number will match any
serial number in the corresponding mode.
.TP
.B "\-t, \-\-transfer-size" " SIZE"
Specify the number of bytes per USB transfer. The optimal value is
usually determined automatically so this option is rarely useful. If
you need to use this option for a device, please report it as a bug.
.TP
.B "\-Z, \-\-upload-size" " SIZE"
Specify the expected upload size, in bytes.
.TP
.BR "\-U, \-\-upload" " FILE"
Read firmware from device into
.BR FILE .
.TP
.BR "\-D, \-\-download" " FILE"
Write firmware from
.B FILE
into device. When FILE is \-, the firmware is read from stdin.
.TP
.B "\-R, \-\-reset"
Issue USB reset signalling after upload or download has finished.
.TP
.BR "\-s, \-\-dfuse-address" " address"
Specify target address for raw binary download/upload on DfuSe devices. Do
.B not
use this for downloading DfuSe (.dfu) files. Modifiers can be added
to the address, separated by a colon, to perform special DfuSE commands such
as "leave" DFU mode, "unprotect" and "mass-erase" flash memory.
.TP
.B "\-v, \-\-verbose"
Print more information about dfu-util's operation. A second
.B -v
will turn on verbose logging of USB requests. Repeat this option to further
increase verbosity.
.TP
.B "\-h, \-\-help"
Show a help text and exit.
.TP
.B "\-V, \-\-version"
Show version information and exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Using dfu-util in the OpenMoko project
(with the Neo1973 hardware)
.PP
Flashing the rootfs:
.br
.B "  $ dfu-util -a rootfs -R -D /path/to/openmoko-devel-image.jffs2"
.PP
Flashing the kernel:
.br
.B "  $ dfu-util -a kernel -R -D /path/to/uImage"
.PP
Flashing the bootloader:
.br
.B "  $ dfu-util -a u-boot -R -D /path/to/u-boot.bin"
.PP
Copying a kernel into RAM:
.br
.B "  $ dfu-util -a 0 -R -D /path/to/uImage"
.sp
Once this has finished, the kernel will be available at the default load
address of 0x32000000 in Neo1973 RAM.
.B Note:
You cannot transfer more than 2MB of data into RAM using this method.
.sp
.SS Using dfu-util with a DfuSe device
.PP
Flashing a
.B .dfu
(special DfuSe format) file to the device:
.br
.B "  $ dfu-util -a 0 -D /path/to/dfuse-image.dfu"
.PP
Reading out 1 KB of flash starting at address 0x8000000:
.br
.B "  $ dfu-util -a 0 -s 0x08000000:1024 -U newfile.bin"
.PP
Flashing a binary file to address 0x8004000 of device memory and
ask the device to leave DFU mode:
.br
.B "  $ dfu-util -a 0 -s 0x08004000:leave -D /path/to/image.bin"
.\" There are no bugs of course
