Adding the lsusb output and a download log of your device here helps
us to avoid regressions for hardware we cannot test while working on
the code. To extract the lsusb output use this command:
sudo lsusb -v -d $USBID > $DEVICE.lsusb
Prepare a description snippet as above, and send it to us. A log
(copy-paste of the command window) of a firmware download is also
nice, please use the double verbose option -v -v and include the
command line in the log file.
