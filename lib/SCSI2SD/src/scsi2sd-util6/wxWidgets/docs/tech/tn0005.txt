                     Adding a wxWidgets contribution
                     ===============================

Here are some different kinds of contribution:

1. Bug fixes. You can send these to the wx-dev list.

2. New classes. They should go somewhere in the wxWidgets 
   hierarchy if they are deemed to be 'core', otherwise they
   could be placed in external repositories of wxWidgets
   utilities, like wxCode (see http://wxcode.sf.net).

3. A utility application, such as a new dialog editor or
   file format conversion utility. If adding to the SVN
   archive, you may put it under the utils hierarchy,
   preferably with further src and docs directories.

You may or may not wish to add your code to the main wxWidgets SVN
archive. Whether your code is appropriate for this archive
should first be ascertained by discussing it on wx-dev@wxwidgets.org.

Also, in order to be included in wxWidgets, your code should
follow the wxWidgets coding conventions 
(see http://www.wxwidgets.org/develop/standard.htm) and fit in the
wxWidgets src, include, docs directories hierarchy.
