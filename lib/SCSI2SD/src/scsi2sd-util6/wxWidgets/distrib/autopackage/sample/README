 A simple autopackaged wxWidgets application
 ==============================================================================

 This directory contains the minimal wxWidgets sample program, a bakefile,
 and an Autopackage spec file; this file shows you how to use them to create
 the release of a wxWidgets-based application for Linux.

 For more info about Autopackage refer to:
  http://autopackage.org

 A generic quick-start guide for non-wxWidgets based applications is at:
  http://autopackage.org/developer-quickstart.html


 Assuming you already have downloaded wxGTK port of wxWidgets, compiled it and
 installed it, you need to install Autopackage and bakefile.
 Search http://autopackage.org and http://bakefile.sourceforge.net for the download
 page and grab the latest release.

 Once you've got your development environment ready, just do from your shell:

    bakefile -f gnu minimal.bkl     # to create the GNUmakefile for our app
    makeinstaller                   # to create the Autopackage for our app

 Yes: it's so easy. Now try to run "package install wxminimal-1.0-1.x86.package' and
 admire your brand-new distro-neutral installer for Linux.
