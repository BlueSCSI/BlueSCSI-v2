This is a wxWidgets Terminal widget conveniently packaged for you.

For doxygen documentation, see: http://jeremysalwen.github.com/TerminalWx/

TerminalWx is taken (with modifications) from the Chameleon IDE (Mark 
Erikson), which itself took (with modifications) from taTelnet (Derry 
Bryson), which itself took (with modifications) from GTerm (Timothy 
Miller).  So this code has a bit of history ;).  All credit to those 
before me, the amount I've contributed is relatively nothing.

It is offered under the terms of the wxWindows License Version 3.1, 
which is basically the LGPL version 2+ with an exception for the 
requirement to distribute the source code with binaries.  (see 
license3.txt for details of the license).

Dependencies
-----

You will need wxgtk version 2.9 or later.
You will also need libwxsmith to compile the test application.
