wxWidgets for DirectFB installation
===================================

IMPORTANT NOTE:

  wxDFB is currently incomplete and some parts of the wxWidgets library
  don't yet compile and must be disabled during configuration. In particular,
  the coverage of wxDC API is limited.


Dependencies
------------

wxDFB requires the DirectFB library (http://www.directfb.org), which must
be installed before compiling wxDFB.


Compiling
---------

Compilation is done in the standard Unix fashion, using configure and make.
Please refer to e.g. wxGTK's install.txt for details if you are unfamiliar
with configure.

When configuring, use the --with-directfb option instead of e.g. --with-gtk
to specify that the wxDFB port should be built. You may also need to disable
wxUniv themes that don't work in wxDFB yet (alternatively you can set the
WXTHEME environment variable to "mono"):

$ ./configure --with-directfb --with-themes=mono
$ make


Configuring fonts
-----------------

DirectFB doesn't have native fonts configuration mechanism (such as
fontconfig used by GTK+) and so wxDFB implements a simple configuration
mechanism itself.

No fonts are installed and configured by "make install", you have to manually
configure fonts after you install the library.

wxDFB looks the fonts up in directories specified in the WXDFB_FONTPATH
environment variable (separated with :, similarly to the PATH variable).  If
the variable is not set, $prefix/share/wx/fonts directory is used. All
subdirectories of the directories on the path are scanned for FontsIndex
files. These files are parsed and fonts defined in them are added to the fonts
list.

The FontsIndex file is standard wxFileConfig file text file. Each toplevel
group specifies one font bundle, font's name is the name of group. Group's
entries look like this:

   [Font Name]
   # font files (at least one of them must be present):
   Regular=RegularFaceFile.ttf
   Italic=ItalicFaceFile.ttf
   Bold=BoldFaceFile.ttf
   BoldItalic=BoldItalicFaceFile.ttf
   # optional tag indicating this font is fixed-with (default is false):
   IsFixed=1

Additionally, there may be DefaultXXX entries at the toplevel for every family
XXX and a Default entry that is shortcut for setting all families' default,
their value is name of the default font:

   # optional tags indicating the default font for given family:
   DefaultDecorative=Font Name
   DefaultRoman=Font Name
   DefaultScript=Font Name
   DefaultSwiss=Font Name
   DefaultModern=Font Name
   DefaultTeletype=Font Name
   # indicate the font that is default for all families (optional):
   Default=Font Name

Any font formats supported by DirectFB (which typically includes formats
supported by the FreeType library) can be used.


Bug reports
-----------

compiler and the error message(s) to the wxwin-developers mailing list at:
