wxWidgets 3.0.1
===============

This directory contains the files containing the sources and documentation of
wxWidgets 3.0.1 release. Please see the binaries subdirectory for the binaries
for the selected platforms/compilers.

Please notice that since the 2.9 series only a single source distribution is
provided instead of the multiple distributions containing only the files for
each port as was done before. So you only need to download wxWidgets-3.0.1.zip
(or .7z for much smaller archive size) for Microsoft Windows systems or
wxWidgets-3.0.1.tar.bz2 for Unix ones, including Mac OS X. The only difference
between these files is that the ZIP (and 7z) archives contain files with DOS
line endings while the tar balls contain files with Unix line endings.

Note for the Windows users: please note that the installer installs *only* the
sources and you still need to compile the library before using it. See binaries
subdirectory for the pre-built binaries for the selected compilers.
