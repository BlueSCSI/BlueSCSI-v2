Outstanding issues

- wxTextCtrl doesn't work as a stream buffer in Linux/gcc.

- No wxToolTip (but see wxToolBar for a way of implementing it).

- Need a way of specifying default settings for colour/font/etc.

- More optimisation could be done to reduce X server traffic, etc.

- Should scrollbars take on the background colour? Not right for
  e.g. wxScrolledWindows, so maybe have wxSystemSettings value for
  scrollbar colour, and/or ability to set scrollbar colour independently.

- wxFrame can accept events, but apps cannot draw into it for
  Workaround: use an embedded wxWindow.

- The background of a window sometimes isn't restored when changing
  notebook pages (see sashtest, mdi examples). The notebook background
  colour shows through. A resize, or scroll, restores the correct
  background colour.

- In Life! sample, text above slider isn't legible.

- samples/html/helpview and samples/help demonstrate that sometimes,
  XPM images can't be loaded, perhaps only in 256-colour mode. This
  will now cause an assert rather than an X error. But we need to
  either cure the XPM loading problem, or provide alternative toolbar
  buttons (for HelpView) and icons (for places where icons are used e.g.
  in the log dialog).
