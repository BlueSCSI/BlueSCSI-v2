           Adding a new app/screenshot to the wxWidgets.org front page
                    =====================================
                    
To add a new app/screenshot to the front page, you first will need to have the 
following:

1. The application Name
2. A URL for the application
3. A series of screenshots for the app

Each screenshot should have a 300 pixel width. A height around 225 pixels is 
preferred, but it's more important to keep the aspect ratio of the screenshot.
Screenshot format is not important, but the important thing is to use the format
that gives you the best ratio of picture compression and size. Also, please 
make sure the screenshots all have the app name in them.

Once you have the screenshots and info ready, take the following steps to 
update the web site:

1) Put the screenshots in <wxWebSite root>/site-v2/images/front_screens

2) Open <wxWebSite root>/site-v2/index.php

3) Look for the "$apps = array();" line. Below it will be a series of items,
which are the data used for each app shown in the front page screenshots.

Add a new line at the bottom, with the following format:

$apps[] = array(appname, appurl, array(screenshot1, screenshot2, ...));

The screenshot1, etc. filenames should not have any path to them. They should
just be the filename. The actual shown screenshot is chosen at random from
the list of screenshots, so order, etc. doesn't matter.

Once you've done this, the new app w/screenshots should appear on the front page!
