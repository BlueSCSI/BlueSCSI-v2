October 6, 2014 -- The wxWidgets team is pleased to announce a
major new release of our open source framework for the development
of native cross-platform applications in C++.

wxWidgets 3.0.2 is a stable bug fix release in 3.0 branch and is
available at

        https://sourceforge.net/downloads/wxwindows/3.0.2/

and at our FTP mirror at

        ftp://ftp.wxwidgets.org/pub/3.0.2/

Please choose the archive format suitable for your platform, i.e. 7z
or ZIP for Windows platforms and tar.bz2 for the Unix systems
including OS X (all archives contain sources for all wxWidgets ports
but they use different line endings) and follow the instructions in
readme.txt file for installing it. Notice that if you decide to use
the Windows installer (.exe file) you still need to build wxWidgets
as only sources, not binaries, are installed.

We also provide the pre-built versions of wxMSW libraries for the
selected compilers at

        https://sourceforge.net/downloads/wxwindows/3.0.2/binaries/

Please see the README file there for the descriptions of the
individual files.


This is a bug fix release with no significant new features compared to
the previous 3.0.x releases and compatible with them at both the API
and the ABI level (i.e. all applications linked against earlier 3.0.x
DLLs or shared libraries will continue to work when using 3.0.2
libraries).

Some of the changes:

* In wxGTK:
 - Fix wxSearchCtrl layout.
 - Fix mouse handling in wxListCtrl and wxTreeCtrl inside wxNotebook.
 - Avoid some GTK+ warnings.

* In wxMSW:
 - Cygwin 1.7 and MinGW 4.8 build fixes.
 - Fix parallel build in MSVS 2010+ solutions.
 - Add x64 configurations to MSVS 2005/2008 projects too.
 - Fix using Esc as accelerator in the menus.
 - Fix wxRadioBox, wxSlider, wxToggleButton with non-default colours.
 - RTL support fixes for wxDC and wxGrid.

* In wxOSX:
 - Avoid compilation warnings when using 10.10 SDK.
 - Enhancements to retina support.

Despite of the focus on bug fixes, a few new features have
nevertheless made it into this release as well:

 - Add support for "%V", "%G" and "%g" to wxDateTime::Format().
 - Added an XRC handler for wxSimplebook.
 - Allow to specify the "variant" window property in XRC.
 - Add wxGenericListCtrl::EndEditLabel().

Other changes in this release are described in the file
docs/changes.txt available online at

    https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/3.0.2/changes.txt

This file also contains information about the changes in 3.0 compared
to earlier versions of wxWidgets, please read it, and especially its
"INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES" section, if you are upgrading from wxWidgets
2.8 or earlier. And for even more details, please see

    http://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.0.0/overview_changes_since28.html



We recommend that you upgrade to wxWidgets 3.0.2 if you already use an
earlier wxWidgets 3.0.x release, the upgrade is completely transparent
and doesn't require any changes in the existing code. If you are still
using wxWidgets 2.8 or earlier, please consider updating to wxWidgets
3.0 to profit from all the new functionality.


We hope that you will enjoy using the new release!

Vadim Zeitlin, on behalf of wxWidgets development team.
