* Refer to INSTALL.Android for Google Android NDK compilation information.

Pre-Requisites
	g++  (4.5.3)
	make (GNU make 3.81)
	zlib (1.2.3)
	doxygen (1.7.4)

Optional
	automake (1.11), autoconf (2.68), libtool (2.4)
		(Required if building from git)

	graphviz (2.26.3) (for dependency diagrams in the generated docs)

When building from sources obtained from the git repository, the configure
script must be created first using the autoconf/automake/libtool packages.
The supplied autogen.sh script automates this process.

*NOTE: it is not necessary to run the autogen.sh script when using a
source distribution release. ie. If you obtained the sources via
libzipper-major.minor.patch.tar.gz, do not run autogen.sh

	./autogen.sh

The configure script creates the makefiles specific to your host. eg. It
allows the paths to dependant packages to be specified.

	./configure --prefix=/usr

The --prefix option specifies the base installation directory, and defaults
to /usr/local (in which case, the library would be installed in /usr/local/lib,
and the zipper binary would be installed in /usr/local/bin).

To obtain a complete listing of configure options, use the --help option.

	./configure --help

Once the configure script is run, the software can be compiled.

	make

Now it's time to install the software. This step must be run by a user with
write access to the installation directory (/usr/local by default).

	make install
