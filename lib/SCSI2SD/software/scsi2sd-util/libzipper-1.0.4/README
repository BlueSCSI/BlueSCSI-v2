libzipper
Michael McMaster <michael@codesrc.com>

libzipper offers a flexible C++ interface for reading and writing compressed
files in multiple formats. It is intended for use in reading small compressed
data files, such as configuration files and saved games.

libzipper currently supports plain, zip, and gzip formats.

libzipper is not a general-purpose archive management library, as it
does not provide access to the filesystem attributes of each file.
(ie. libzipper does not support the concepts of file owner, group or
permissions.

Missing Features
