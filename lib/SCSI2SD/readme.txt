SCSI2SD, The SCSI Hard Drive Emulator for retro computing.


Traditional hard drives last X years. Maybe, if you're luckly, you'll get X years of
service from a particular drive. The lubricants wear out, the spindles rust.
SCSI2SD is a modern replacement for failed drives.  It allows the use ofvintage 
computer hardware long after their mechanical drives fail. The use of SD memory cards
solves the problem of transferring data between the retro computer and a
modern PC (who still has access to a working floppy drive ?)

Features:
	Terminator, termpwr, firmware upgradable (via the SD card)
	Selectable SCSI ID (via jumpers)
	Emulates a non-removable hard drive (does not present as a removable memory card reader) for maximum compatibility.
	Unit attention configurability.

Technical Specifications:
SCSI Interface: SCSI-2 Narrow 8-bit 50-pin connector.
SD Card Support:
	(state max size)
	Currently SD standard (1GB), no SDHC/SDXC support.
Power:
Dimensions:

Performance:
Sequential read/write:  250kb/sec, 50kb/sec. Add some results of some SCSI hard drives
for comparison. 160Mb, 250Mb, 1Gb.

Compatibility:
Tested with Linux, Apple Macintosh System 7.5 on LC-II, LC-III, and LC-475 hardware.
Love to hear your success stories on other platforms.
