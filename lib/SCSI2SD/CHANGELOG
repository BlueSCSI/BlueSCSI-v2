20150x0x		4.5
	- Fix bug in SCSI MODE SENSE that returned the wrong mode type
		- Fixes CDROM emulation

20150813		4.4
	- Added configuration option to allow SCSI2 mode. This option is OFF by
	default, and should only be enabled when using the SCSI2SD with a SCSI2 host
	controller. Extra timing delays are added in the default SCSI1/SASI mode to
	work with slow hardware.
	- Modified hot-swap card detection to work with longer (60cm) microSD to SD
	cables.
	- Fixed off-by-one error in scsi2sd-util "Auto" sector start feature.
	- Fixed crashes and stalls of scsi2sd-util after saving/loading options
	to/from the device
	- Fixed synchronous transfer request negotiation.
	SCSI2SD now negotiates back to async transfers instead of simply
	rejecting the message.
	- Fixed INQUIRY response to commands lacking an allocation length.
	- Firmware development updated to PSoC Creator 3.2 (from 3.1)

20150614        4.3
	- Added configurable disk geometry.
	- Added configuration import/export function to scsi2sd-util
	- scsi2sd-util stability fixes
	- Fixes to support EMU EMAX1 & 2

20150504		4.2.4
	- Clean up version number mishap (4.2.3 reported as 4.2.2)
	- Reduce size of mode pages for SCSI1 hosts
	- Stability improvements whan handling resets during SCSI reads.

20150420		4.2.3
	- Bugfix for failed flash checksums after configing configuration

20150420		4.2.2
	- Improved compatibility with older SCSI1 hosts.

20150123		4.1.1
	- Fix MODE SENSE bug when the allocation length is less than the
	page size.
	- Add WRITE BUFFER and WRITE AND VERIFY support.
	- Fix rare case of very slow performance

20150201		4.1
	- Rewrite of the SD card interface to fix compatibility problems.
		This fixes write issues with Samsung SD cards.
	- Workaround for SCSI hosts that set 250ms timeouts. Some NCR53C80/53C9X
	drivers (openbsd, netbsd, and others) set a byte-to-byte timeout which
	can be exceeded by SD card latency.
	- Upgrade to PSoC Creator 3.1 and gcc 4.8.4.
	- Integrated scsi2sd-debug functionality with scsi2sd-util.

20150108		4.0
	- Fix handling requests for LUNs other than 0 from SCSI-2 hosts.
	- Handle glitches of the scsi signals to improve stability and operate with
	multiple devices on the SCSI bus.
	- Re-add parity checking. This can be disabled using scsi2sd-config if
	required.
	- Added disconnect/reconnect support during SD card writes.
	- Preliminary CDROM device support (incomplete)
	- New configuration method. Data is now stored in flash to allow room for
	custom VPD tables. The old eeprom configuration is ignored.
	- Support for up to 4 SCSI targets.
	- scsi2sd-config and bootloader hosts utilities are replaced by the
	new scsi2sd-util GUI.
	- Fix for SD cards with Samsung controllers which expect a "stop" bit
	in each SD command over SPI.
	- Hot-swap support. The SD card can be removed whenever it's not in use
	(ie. the LED must be OFF when the SD card is removed)

20140718		3.5.2
	- Fix blank SCSI ID in scsi2sd-config output.

20140717		3.5.1
	- Allow building utilities on older Linux distros
	- Resolve missing DLL issues for the Windows utilities
	- Fix scsi2sd-config crash on Mac.

20140713		3.5
	- Fixed several performance issues. Transfer rates up to 2.5MB/s are now
	possible.
	- Implemented the READ BUFFER scsi command for performance testing purposes.
	- Added support for the new "yellow" v4.2 revision boards.
	- Improved firmware uploading. bootloaderhost can now reset the board back
	to the bootloader.
	- Display firmware version in scsi2sd-config
	- Add "--reset" parameter to scsi2sd-config

20140418		3.4
	- Critical fix for writes when using non-standard block sizes.
	- Fix to ensure SCSI phase bits are set atomically.
	- Always return the requested number of bytes for a REQUEST SENSE command
		This is required to support the Ensoniq ASR-10.
	- Decreased (unused) heap and stack sizes to prepare for a memory
	write cache
	- Increased the maximum sector size to 8192 bytes.

20140416		3.3
	- Fix to SCSI Reset handling to avoid lockups
	- Bug fixes to improve standards compatibility
	- Bug fix for Unit Attention Condition, which is now enabled by default.
		scsi2sd-config can be used to disable it for those systems that
		truely require it (eg. Mac Plus).
	- Added Linked commands support.
	- Added support for configurable sector sizes between 64 and 2048 bytes.
		The sector size can be set via the MODE SELECT command using a SCSI
		format utility, or via scsi2sd-config
	- Powerbook firmware added

20140214		3.2
	- Remove hacks around ATN handling, and implement proper select-with-atn
	support.  This fix is essential for communicating with some SCSI hosts.
	All SCSI2SD users are urged to upgrade to this firmware version.
	- More fixes to support Apple HD SC Setup (thanks to Doug Brown!)
	- Fixes to support SCSI1 initiators
		* Support non-arbitrating initiators.
		* Support single-initiator option.
		* Set CCS response format flag in INQUIRY response.

20131227		3.1
	- Fixes for better SCSI reset handling
	- Fix for reading the last sector of the SD card.
	- Performance improvements. 2.5x read, 2x write performance.

20131209		3.0.1
	- Bugfix release.
	- Fixes to support formatting with Apple HD SC Setup. This is very slow,
		Apple Drive Setup is preferred
	- Reliability improvement for rejecting unknown SCSI messages.
	- Reliability improvements for SD card initialisation and reading.


20131027		3.0
	- Initial public release.
