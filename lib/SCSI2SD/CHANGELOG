20201012		6.3.2
	- Increase limit of READ/WRITE BUFFER command for improved compatibility
	SGI Iris hosts
	- Add new config option to enable blind writes to improve SD card write
	performance. This was previously enabled default but causes problems
	with some SCSI hosts.

20200419		6.3.1
	- Added checks to ensure the correct firmware version is loaded.
	V6 Rev.f and older boards need the "firmware.V6.revF.dfu" firmware updates.
	V6 2020c and newer boards need the "firmware.V6.2020.dfu" firmware updates.

20200216		6.3.0
	- Breaking change: Firmware updates on windows now require the UsbDK
	driver to be installed.

	- Fix regression preventing some machines from booting
	- Update libusb to 1.0.23 for dfu-util
	- Modify dfu-util to use the UsbDk driver via libusb.

20200130		6.2.15
	- Fix issue writing more than 512kb of data in one write command
	(bug introduced 6.2.7)
	- Fix possible data corruption bug when reading or writing more than
	64kb per command (fixed in most cases by 6.2.14)

20200101		6.2.14
	- Fix for invalid CDROM READ TOC responses (Thanks Simon Gander)
	- Fix for data corruption for hosts that transfer more than 64k per
	write.

20191208		6.2.9
	- Fix to prevent sending floppy geometry mode page when not configured as
	a floppy (Thanks Landon Rodgers)
	- Fix for VMS 5.5-2 Inquiry allocation lengths. Requires setting "vms" quirk
	mode in the XML config (Thanks Landon Rodgers)

20191030		6.2.8
	- Fix incorrect results from the self-test function.

20191009		6.2.7
	- Slight improvements to data throughput, which may assist SCSI hosts with
	short timeouts.

20190529		6.2.5
	- Add scsi mode page 0 support
	- Fix SD card hotswap bug when the SCSI host is constantly polling

20190502		6.2.4 (Beta)
	- Port XEBEC support from v5 firmware
	- Add Flexible Disk Drive Geometry SCSI MODE page
	- Stability improvements
	- Fix regression from 6.1.3 firmware for Kurzweil K2000

20181011		6.2.1
	- Fix bug in USB disk interface with disks over 4GB

20180926        6.2.0
	- Fix bug with non-512 byte sectors.
	- Fix bug when writing with multiple SCSI devices on the chain
	- Performance improvements to write speeds.

20180430		6.1.4
	- Fix bug in self-test function

20180131		6.1.3
	- Fix bug that caused stability issues with 10MB/s transfers.

20171128		6.1.2
	- Fix synchronous negotiation bugs

20170520		6.1.1
	- Performance improvements to improve throughput at all scsi speeds
	- Add new "turbo" speed option to boost speeds.
		- May not be reliable, and use is not supported.
		- Async timings trimmed
		- Sync speeds boosted to theoretical 15.625MB/s, with 12.0MB/s measured
		read througput.
		- SD card put in "high speed" mode.
		- USB for configuration/firmware updates is disabled in turbo mode when
		processing SCSI commands. A power cycle may be required to connect
		via USB to reset the 48MHz clock back to 48MHz.
	- Fix scsi2sd-util6 size and sector-size inputs
	- Fix crash when configured scsi disk starting sector is less than
	SD card size

20170329		6.1.0
	- Enable synchronous transfers on SCSI1 hosts
	- Support 4MB/s sync transfers for Amiga A590 (WD33C93)
	- Merge v4.7 release changes, excluding custom mode/inquiry pages
	- various bug fixes

20161006		6.0.13
