20200419		6.3.1
	- Added checks to ensure the correct firmware version is loaded.
	V6 Rev.f and older boards need the "firmware.V6.revF.dfu" firmware updates.

20180430		6.1.4
	- Fix bug in self-test function

20180131		6.1.3
	- Fix bug that caused stability issues with 10MB/s transfers.

20171128		6.1.2
	- Fix synchronous negotiation bugs

20170520		6.1.1
	- Performance improvements to improve throughput at all scsi speeds
	- Add new "turbo" speed option to boost speeds.
		- May not be reliable, and use is not supported.
		- Async timings trimmed
		- Sync speeds boosted to theoretical 15.625MB/s, with 12.0MB/s measured
		read througput.
		- SD card put in "high speed" mode.
		- USB for configuration/firmware updates is disabled in turbo mode when
		processing SCSI commands. A power cycle may be required to connect
		via USB to reset the 48MHz clock back to 48MHz.
	- Fix scsi2sd-util6 size and sector-size inputs
	- Fix crash when configured scsi disk starting sector is less than
	SD card size
